I program things, sometimes

Currently working on:
- An [editor for VRChat's camera dolly system](https://github.com/MissingNO123/VRC-Camera-Dolly-Editor) 
- A proof-of-concept [AI Assistant](https://github.com/MissingNO123/VRChat_AI_Assistant) for VRChat
- A way to [wake or sleep your VR base stations](https://github.com/MissingNO123/VRBS_Power_Control) through a script
- Other projects not uploaded to GitHub
